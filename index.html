								<h3><a>TCP/IP AGV Control System</a></h3>
								<p>Created a control system for AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) robots using C#, with a client application allowing users to 
									<span class="additional-description">define missions for tasks like "picking up," "dropping," and "parking" at different stations. The system accommodates three mission types across 20 designated stations per user frame, and user instructions are seamlessly transmitted to the AGV robot for execution via ModbusRTU and TCP/IP communication.</span>

								<h3><a>Yazaki Production Planner</a></h3>
								<p>During my internship at Yazaki Tanger, I developed a production planning software using C++. This application takes into
									<span class="additional-description"> account backlogs and utilizes input data from three Excel documents: SAP forecasts, product definitions, and MPS (Master Production Schedule). It begins by defining products (FMs) based on their definitions and then generates production plans considering manufacturing capabilities and backlog data from the MPS. The final output is a comprehensive plan that can be saved as an Excel file for further use.</span>

								<h3><a>Isothermal Chamber</a></h3>
								<p>Created an isothermal chamber for heat transfer education, utilizing 3D modeling and rendering with SolidWorks and 
									<span class="additional-description">complex systems engineering analysis. The chamber serves as a practical platform for university students to determine heat transfer coefficients in solid materials. Additionally, a real-time dashboard, developed with Node-Red, displays data from sensors connected to an ESP8266 through MQTT, enabling temperature control of the heat source.</span>
